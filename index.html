                    <h2>Contemporary VCE Biology Teaching Sequences</h2>
                    <p>Presented here are teaching sequences that bring contemporary biology into the classroom. Pre-service teaching students from Deakin University have worked with scientists and education academics to develop and deliver teaching and learning sequences that could contribute to students learning in VCE Biology. The focus is on bringing current research science and practice into the VCE Biology Study Design.</p>

                        <p>This teaching sequence introduces immunity and explores the ABO blood groups to provide insight into the antigenic response. Helen Haysom enriches this sequence with her expertise in blood typing and transfusions. Pathogens as an antigen source, the non-specific and specific immune responses to invading pathogens and the lymphatic system are investigated.</p>

                        <p>This teaching sequence uses the research undertaken by Dr. Nancy Endersby-Harshman investigating control measures for mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) to examine the impact of human culture and technological applications on biological processes. This is an excellent example of developing strategies to deal with the emergence of new diseases in a globally connected world.</p>

                        <p>This four-module sequence presents an inquiry-based unit that links the research of Professor Leigh Ackland on metastatic breast cancer with cellular signalling and the stimulus-response model. Contextualised learning experiences with authentic explorative and elaborative activities are used to explore these concepts.</p>

                        <p>This learning sequence uses contemporary research in evolution undertaken by Dr Matthew Symonds and his PhD student Uday to provide a context for investigating evolutionary relationships. Studying the Aloe vera plant provides this context for investigating biogeography and phylogenetic trees to help reconstruct the evolutionary history of organisms and help explain how they came to be where they are.</p>
