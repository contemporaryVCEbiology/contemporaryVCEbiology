                <h2>Contemporary Biology Contexts for VCE Biology</h2>
                <p>Presented here are five units of work that bring contemporary biology into the classroom. Master of Teaching students from Deakin University have worked with scientists and education academics to develop and deliver useful teaching and learning sequences that could contribute to students learning in VCE Biology.  The focus is on bringing current science into the VCE Biology study design.</p>
