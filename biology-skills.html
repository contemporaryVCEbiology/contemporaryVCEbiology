                            <p><b>VCE Biology Units 1 – 4; Victorian Curriculum 7-10</b></p>
                            <p>Students learn about the process of conducting fieldwork through a multi-part video guide narrated by Dr. Anneke Veenstra who uses a case study of recent macro-invertebrate research to provide the context for this learning sequence. The Science Skills addressed apply to all secondary students and the activities provided give students experience in analysing raw fieldwork data.</p>
